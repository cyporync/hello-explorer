    <p>Earth’s Moon is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the solar system and the only celestial body beyond Earth
      that humans have visited, with the first landing occurring in 1969 during NASA’s Apollo 11 mission. It formed
      about 4.5 billion years ago, likely from debris created by a massive collision between early Earth and a
      Mars-sized object called Theia. The Moon is about 3,474 kilometers (2,159 miles) in diameter—roughly one-quarter
      the size of Earth—and has a gravitational pull about one-sixth as strong, allowing astronauts to leap high above
      its surface. Its surface is covered in impact craters, ancient lava plains called maria, and a thick layer of fine
      dust known as regolith. The Moon is tidally locked to Earth, meaning the same side always faces our planet, and it
      plays a crucial role in stabilizing Earth’s axial tilt and driving ocean tides. With no substantial atmosphere,
      the Moon experiences extreme temperature swings, ranging from about −173°C (−280°F) at night to 127°C (260°F)
      during the day, making it a harsh yet scientifically invaluable window into the early history of the solar system.
