    <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known world in the universe to support life, formed about
      4.54 billion years ago from the remnants of the early solar system. Roughly 71% of its surface is covered by
      liquid water, which plays a critical role in regulating climate and sustaining biological processes. Earth’s
      atmosphere is composed primarily of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), creating conditions suitable for respiration
      and protecting life through the ozone layer, which absorbs harmful ultraviolet radiation. Beneath the surface, a
      dynamic interior with a molten outer core generates a powerful magnetic field that shields the planet from solar
      wind and cosmic radiation. Earth’s tectonic plates slowly shift across the mantle, reshaping continents, forming
      mountains, triggering earthquakes, and recycling carbon through the rock cycle. Orbiting the Sun once every 365.25
      days and rotating on a tilted axis of about 23.5 degrees, Earth experiences seasons, diverse climates, and an
      extraordinary range of ecosystems—from deep ocean trenches to high-altitude ice caps—making it a uniquely complex
      and living planet. 🌍</p>
